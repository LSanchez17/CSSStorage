  CSS Shop 

* This is a repository that contains a lot of CSS. Mainly stuff I've made here and there throughout the years for easy storage and retrieval to other projects.  Some of these are items that were cut or just not a fit anywhere else. Some of them are just layouts to try and improve my design skills. Some are just for fun

* To load up a layout, *uncomment* out the ``@import url('CUSTOM_LAYOUT')`` you want to test out in the appropriate layout folder, and it should render
